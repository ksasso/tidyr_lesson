## Learner Persona: Julie

<div class="column-left">
- Background
  + Early career financial audit analyst. Does reporting on financial trends & rolling average projections
  + Bachelor's degree in finance in 2015
  
- Relevant Experience
  + Has been using excel and ACL (Audit Control Language) daily at work for the past 3 years 
  + Will occasionally use R at work to make a graph or play with a regression model out, but does most data prep & reporting in excel
  + Comes to monthly to R-Ladies meetups and has taken R-Ladies Intro to R courses covering
    - R & RStudio Basics (R Objects, RStudio, Data Types & Structures, Functions & Arguments)
    - Data Wrangling basics (pipes & dplyr: filter, slice, select, mutate, etc.)
    - Visualization & Communication (ggplot2, intro to RMarkdown)
</div>  

<div class="column-left">
- Needs
  + To spend less time cutting/pasting and manually manipulating things in excel to make weekly reports
    - Would love to just press a button every Monday to generate report
  + Would like to make nicer charts for weekly sales projections and capture rates
  + Would love to give her team a dashboard instead of a static report with multiple tables
  + More accurate sales forecasts than her 8wk avg can achieve
  
- Special Considerations
  + Has a heavy meeting schedule
  + Visual learner
</div>

## Tidy Data

<div class="column-left-wide">

relig_income data[^relig_income]

[^relig_income]:The relig_income dataset comes from a report produced by the Pew Research Center, examining the relationship between income and religion in the U.S.

</div>

<div class="column-left-narrow">

- each **variable** must have its own **column**
- each **observations** must have its own **row**
- each **value** must have its own **cell**
  + Impossible to satisfy 2 of 3 rules
  
- Why Tidy?
  + Key R functions (i.e., mutate, select, ggplot, filter) work on vectors of values
  + Consistency in storage = consistency in tools that work
  
</div>
  

## Is this Tidy Data?

```{r formative_assessment1, echo=FALSE}
preg.tbl <- read.table(text= "Pregnant,Not.Pregnant
0,5
1,4", header=T, sep=",", row.names=c("Male", "Female"))

preg.tbl %>%
kable("html")
```

Hint: 

- What are the variables in this data?
- What are the rows? 
- What are the columns?
- Remember our 3 rules (column = variable, row = observation, cell = value)

## Answer: it can be tidier!

```{r, eval=T, echo=F}
kable(preg.tbl)
```

- What are the variables in this data?        
    `Sex`, `Pregnancy`, `n` 
- What are rows?    
    **Rows** are the **values of a variable**, `sex`, not **observations**
- What are columns?     
    **Columns** are the **values of a variable**,`pregnant`, not **variables** 

## A tidier version

```{r}
preg.tbl %>% 
  mutate(sex = row.names(.)) %>% 
  pivot_longer(-sex, names_to = c('pregnant'), values_to = 'count')
```

- **rows** are **observations** of counts of people falling into sex X pregnancy status combinations
- **columns** are **variables** reflecting your key metrics (sex, pregnant, count)

## How do I do it?

1. Figure out what the variables and observations are
2. Figure out if you need to your table to be
   - longer: one variable spread across multiple columns
   - wider: one observation scattered across multiple rows

- Two key tidyr functions for solving
  + pivot_longer (previously gather)
    - makes datasets longer by increasing the number of rows and decreasing the number of columns
  + pivot_wider  (previously spread)
    -  "widens" data, increasing the number of columns and decreasing the number of rows

- Let's try it out!
